<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>We are making a game in which you have 4 characters that battle against each other in 3 different types of maps which are the users choice on what they want to play. Each character will have a certain number of HP points and it will decrease throughout the course of the game. We want to ideally have your phone as a controller otherwise we will have keyboard controllers.</p>
